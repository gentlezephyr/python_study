List comprehension in Python is a compact way to create lists by iterating over existing lists. It is a powerful tool that can be used to transform and filter data in a single line of code. 

`new_todos = [item.strip("\n") for item in todos]`

Map function in Python is used to apply a function to each item in a list and return a new list with the results. In this case, we are using it to remove the newline character from each item in the todos list.
