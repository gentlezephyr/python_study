Today I learned about the match case in python, and how it can be used to compare a value to a series of values to see if it matches any of them. It's similar to switch case in Java or switch case in C#, but it's a bit more flexible.

I learned about the bitwise operator OR too.

break is a keyword in python, and it's used to exit a loop or a function. It's used to exit a loop or a function, and it's not a built-in function in python. It's a reserved keyword in python.

for loops are used to iterate over a sequence. They have a condition that is evaluated before each iteration, and they execute the code inside the loop if the condition is true. The loop continues until the condition is false.
