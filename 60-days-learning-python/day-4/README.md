Here's a breakdown of how the code snippet for the "edit" case works:

case "edit":: This line checks if the user selected the "edit" option.

number = int(input("Enter the number of the TODO you want to edit: ")): This line prompts the user to enter the number of the TODO item they want to edit. The input is converted to an integer and stored in the variable number.

number -= 1: Since list indices start from 0 but the user will likely input a number starting from 1, this line decrements number by 1 to match the list index.

new_todo = input("Enter the new TODO: "): The user is asked to input the new TODO item, which is stored in the variable new_todo.

todos[number] = new_todo.capitalize(): Finally, this line replaces the old TODO item at index number with the new TODO item stored in new_todo. The capitalize() method is used to ensure the first letter of the new TODO is capitalized.

This sequence of steps allows the user to select a TODO item by its number, update it with a new description, and store the updated TODO list.
